# Commonly Used Python IDEs used at UVA

There are a lot of different ways you can interact with Python, and each person will have their own preferences. Here are some of the most common ways to interact with Python used at UVA.

| IDE Name | Short description of benefits | Any Disadvantages? |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | All purpose code editor that can be used with many languages, including jupyter notebooks. Also, includes many available extensions that can further extend utility, as desired (including using GitHub CoPilot, which students can get for free!)| Might have more functionality than is necessary for all |
| [Jupyter Notebooks/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) | Simple and readable editor that prints outputs/figures directly underneath code, making it good for quick visualization. Also, incorporates markdown, allowing for easy organization of code. | Not great for editing normal python and text files (.py, .txt, etc.)
