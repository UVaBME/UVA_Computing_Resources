## Good Resources
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf): This is a great, free textbook for learning AND understanding the basis for data mining/machine learning approaches, and how to implement these techniques in python (there is a similar textbook for R users).
