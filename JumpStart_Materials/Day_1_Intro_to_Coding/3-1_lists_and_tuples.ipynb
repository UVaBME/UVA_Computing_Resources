    "To this point, we have focused on variables holding a single value or operations performed only once. But, what if we have many values that we want to store or many operations that we want to perform? This is where lists and loops come in. In this module, we will learn how to harness the power of lists and loops to make our code more efficient and powerful.\n",

    "Learning objectives of this module:\n",
    "1. __Learn the purpose of lists, how to create one, and how to manipulate them.__\n",
    "2. Learn how to use loops to repeat operations, including how to use loops to iterate through lists. There are two main types of loops we will discuss:\n",
    "    - For loops\n",
    "    - While loops\n",
    "3. Learn how to combine loops with conditionals to create more complex programs.\n",

Sets are created using curly braces `{}`. Sets are particularly useful for comparing groups of elements to look for overlap (think venn diagrams).\n",
