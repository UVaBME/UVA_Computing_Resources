# UVA Computing Resources, learning and using programming at UVA for Biology and Biomedical Engineering
This resource was established by the UVA BME community (started in July 2023)

## How to add new resources to this repo.
To add a new resource, create a new markdown file .md and link to it in this Table Of Contents. 
For quick understanding of how to use markdown, [see this resource](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Table of Contents
1. [JumpStart Materials](JumpStart_Materials)
2. [R@UVA](R_Resources/R_at_UVA.md)
3. [Python@UVA](Python_Resources)
     1. [Finding and Getting Resources in Python at UVA](Python_Resources/Python_at_UVA.md)
     2. [Python Code Editors, Software, and Packages used at UVA](Python_Resources/Python_Software_and_Packages.md)
4. [Converting between Python, R, and Matlab](Platform_Conversion_Table.md)



If you don't see what you need in this repository, you could try looking for something in this [external github repository](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) with links to all the free coding resources you could ever want and more.

## How to find help at UVA
If you need help with coding, we welcome you to contact one of the postdocs or students below. We also are planning a regular "coding office hours" session with several in the BME department where you can get any questions you have answered.


Alex Clark, apc5un@virginia.edu:
I was an instructor for JumpStart Day 1, teaching programming fundamentals in Python. My preferred language is Python, but I also have experience with Matlab and R. Recently, I used these languages for ODE modeling and simulations, but am now learning some sequencing analysis tools. I also have experience with bash, git/GitHub, machine learning, statistical analysis, and plotting in Python. I can also help with high-power computing on Rivanna.
 
Sarah Groves, smgroves@virginia.edu:
I was an instructor for JumpStart Day 2, teaching the intro to data analysis section. Python is my preferred language, and I am happy to help with any problems that are related to Python, GitHub/version control, or bash/command line. I have a lot of experience with analysis of sequencing or other high-dimensional data, pandas and plotting, graph/network analyses, statistical analysis, and machine learning methods.

Michael Rariden, rariden@virginia.edu:
I instructed during JumpStart Day 1. My preferred language is Python, but I have experience in Matlab. I also extensively use git, bash, and SLURM. My projects now deal with image analysis and segmentation using some deep learning. 

Sam Crowl, sc8wf@virginia.edu:
I was an instructor for JumpStart Day 1, teaching the lists and loops section. I work predominantly in Python, with limited experience in Matlab and R. I have the most experience performing clustering, machine learning, and network-based tools in Python, as well as doing plotting and statistical analysis on large datasets (mostly processed mass spectrometry/proteomic data). I also have experience working in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and on Rivanna.
